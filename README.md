# Writing simulation and analysis tools using F# and Z3

## Introduction

This practical is intended as a brief introduction to the F# programming language and the SMT solver Z3. In the course of this practical you will be performing two types of biological simulation; you will be writing a small Gillespie simulator for the single progenitor model of epithelial stem cells, and editing and exploring logical models of small biological networks. This practical builds on the discussions of F# and Z3 in lecture 4, and the demonstrations in the associated supervision. The goal of this practical is to allow you to see how you model different systems using a functional programming language (F#) and formal logic (using Z3). The first section introduces the programming tools we are using- specifically Jupyter Notebooks- whilst the second and third sections concern the single progenitor model and network motifs. Questions in each section are intended to reinforce your knowledge from the lectures and your understanding of the practical.
